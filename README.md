# Reduced Backgammon Gym
A reduced backgammon gym, making it viable for classical reinforcement learning


## Observation and Action Space

Printing the observation space should be done using:
> print(env.observation_space)
This should print an attributed of type Space, and describe the format of valid observations.

The same could be done for the action space:
> print(env.action_space)
Which should print an attribute of type Space, and describe the format of valid actions.
